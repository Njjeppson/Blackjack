This Java program recieves input choices from the user in order to simulate a game of Blackjack.

I wrote this software in order to deepen my understanding of Java in a way that is both fun and complex.

# Future Work

* In the future, I intend to improve the dealer's AI to calculate a more accurate total to a real-life scenario.
* I may also use an array to store the possible card values in order to simulate the size of a real deck.
